# Cat vs Dog Classifier using CNN in Pytorch

This projects contains a CNN Classifier for classifying images. PyTorch Deep Learning Library is used for it.

Dataset can be downloaded from [LINK](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-5pxr56iH5e1dDOfhJ4AqABDkcbVpE-v?usp=sharing).
Download the folder and place it as `../Cat_Dog_Classifier_CNN/cats_and_dogs_small'`
